I will provide as context a consensus response of several evaluations of a patient's eligibility for various clinical trials. Please create a JSON based on the consensus. I will provide the exact structure that the JSON object should take using a JSON that currently contains definitions of each key as a string. If the statement in the key is true according to the consensus opinion, assign the binary value True to the key. If the patient does not meet the definition of the key, assign the value False. If expert opinions differ, take the majority opinion. If the consensus opinion states that the information was not mentioned or is unable to be determined, assign the value null. Your output should contain only the valid JSON object in a code block with no newlines and no extra explanations.
